# Code Forge | PDF Offer Generator (Frontend)

Interface for automatic generation of commercial offers in PDF format with the branded “forge” style.  
Works together with the FastAPI backend: the manager fills out the form, selects services — and downloads the ready PDF.

---

## Features

- Modern design: dark theme, “Code Forge” branding
- Convenient form for entering client info and selecting services
- Automatic PDF download (generated by the backend)
- Note that email sending is available only in production
- Service list is loaded from the backend (API)

## Technologies
